In this mock case study, I explored the Wolt food delivery app. During my experience, I noticed several areas for improvement. First, I discovered that many local restaurants weren't listed, which limited my options, particularly when trying to order from my favorite spots. Additionally, I encountered delivery delays due to two key factors: extended preparation times at the restaurant and the delivery partner's lack of knowledge about the most efficient routes. Lastly, there was a transparency issue with the delivery fees, as they were hidden until the checkout stage, leading to unexpected costs.
