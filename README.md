A brief discription of my product owner portfolio:
A mock case study on Wolt food app,when using the app, I found that not all restaurants in my local city were listed this limited my chooice of food i order from my favorite restaurant. 
Also faced delivery delays in the app, from the preparation time taken by the restaurant to the delivery service partner not knowing the best route to take for a faster delivery and faced transparency issue in the delivery fees being hidden during checkout.
